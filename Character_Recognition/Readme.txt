                                                   Hi everyone !!!

                                                I am RHYTHM BHATNAGAR

             I'll be showing you guys my CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR) project for the Grip the Sparks Foundation.

                                                 So let's START !!!

Step 1. First we need to install all the modules required...like the: 
       
        * open-cv
        * tesseract
        * numpy
        ( with the help of pip )

Step 2. Download all the test images and store it a folder.

Step 3. In your main program code file import cv2, pytesseract, numpy.

Step 4. Access the input image of which u need to recognize the characters/ text from.

Step 5. Use the open-cv and the numpy modules and its functions to perform erosion and dilation.

Step 6. Call the tesseract and use it to recognize the text/ characters from your test image.

Step 7. Print the result.

Observation: You can observe the code runs with an accuracy of approx. 98% which is quite good!!
and is unable to recognize EACH AND EVERY character of the images...


                                                      THANK YOU !!!
